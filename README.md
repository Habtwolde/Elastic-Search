Oracle → Elasticsearch with Logstash & ELSER

Step 1 — Install Oracle Database Free (XE) on Windows and load sample data
1. Install Oracle Database Free (XE)

2. Test that Oracle is up

Open Command Prompt (or PowerShell) and run:

 ```   
  sqlplus system@localhost:1521/XEPDB1
 ```
3. Create an application user
At the SQL> prompt, run this (replace the password as you like):
```
ALTER USER system IDENTIFIED BY "NewStrongPassword#2025";

exit
```
Test new login
```
sqlplus system/NewStrongPassword#2025@localhost:1521/XEPDB1
```
4. Create a new user/schema

```
CREATE USER es_user IDENTIFIED BY "EsUserPass#2025"
  DEFAULT TABLESPACE users
  TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp
  QUOTA UNLIMITED ON users;
```
5. Grant permissions
```
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO es_user;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW TO es_us
```
6. Create sample table + seed data (and make it update-friendly)

Paste the following exactly into your SQL> session (you’re inside sqlplus as es_user):
```
CREATE TABLE docs (
  id          NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  title       VARCHAR2(400),
  body        CLOB,
  updated_at  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX docs_updated_at_idx ON docs (updated_at);
```
