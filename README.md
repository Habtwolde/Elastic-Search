Oracle â†’ Elasticsearch with Logstash & ELSER

Step 1 â€” Install Oracle Database Free (XE) on Windows and load sample data
1. Install Oracle Database Free (XE)

2. Test that Oracle is up

Open Command Prompt (or PowerShell) and run:

 ```   
  sqlplus system@localhost:1521/XEPDB1
 ```
3. Create an application user
At the SQL> prompt, run this (replace the password as you like):
```
ALTER USER system IDENTIFIED BY "NewStrongPassword#2025";

exit
```
Test new login
```
sqlplus system/NewStrongPassword#2025@localhost:1521/XEPDB1
```
4. Create a new user/schema

```
CREATE USER es_user IDENTIFIED BY "EsUserPass#2025"
  DEFAULT TABLESPACE users
  TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp
  QUOTA UNLIMITED ON users;
```
5. Grant permissions
```
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO es_user;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW TO es_us
```
6. Create sample table + seed data (and make it update-friendly)

Paste the following exactly into your SQL> session (youâ€™re inside sqlplus as es_user):
```
CREATE TABLE docs (
  id          NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  title       VARCHAR2(400),
  body        CLOB,
  updated_at  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX docs_updated_at_idx ON docs (updated_at);
```
Insert a few rows into docs
```
INSERT INTO docs (title, body) VALUES (
  'Bekele records',
  'Kenenisa Bekele set multiple world records in long-distance running.'
);

INSERT INTO docs (title, body) VALUES (
  'USMNT Gold Cup',
  'U.S. men''s national team won the Gold Cup in a thrilling penalty shootout.'
);

INSERT INTO docs (title, body) VALUES (
  'Jamaica weather',
  'Heavy rainfall caused flooding in Jamaica and disrupted travel.'
);

COMMIT;
```
Run these, then ðŸ‘‰ You should see 3 rows:

```
SELECT id, title, SUBSTR(body,1,80) AS body_preview, updated_at
FROM docs
ORDER BY id;
```

Step 3 â€” Logstash JDBC pipeline (Docker)

1. Make folders for the Logstash build
